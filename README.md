# xrv124

A set of scripts for the analysis and visualization of data acquired by the Logos XRV-124 scintillating cone. Analysis currently includes, for a selection of gantry angles and beam energies:

  * Spot shifts (in x and y of the BEV coordinates)
  * Spot sizes (in both BEV and "spot" coordinate systems; see documentation)


## Usage
To run the analysis: ```python xrv124_run.py```.  

You will need the full data set acquired during monthly QA, with beams corresponding to the gantry angles and energies specified in xrv124_run.py
