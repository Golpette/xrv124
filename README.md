# xrv124

A set of scripts for the analysis and visualization of data acquired by the Logos XRV-124 scintillating cone. Analysis currently includes, at all gantry angles and beam energies:

  * Spot shifts
  * Spot sizes (in both "image" and "spot" coordinate systems; see documentation)


## Usage
To run the analsysis: ```python xrv124_run.py```. However you will need the full data set acquired during monthly QA.
